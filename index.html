        The Former President, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's commitment to meet with
        students and inspire them had a deep impact on thousands of students,
        teachers and others through them. He could intract with the students of
        all regions, levels, rural, urban and all ages. I had great admiration
        for him who left his home to Rashtrapathi Bhavan with just one suit case
        when the Government of India sent officials to bring him to Rahstrapathi
        with a big Military truck to carry his personal luggage! He stunned them
        with his very ordinary suit case saying that is all he possessed. His
        exit from Rashtrapathi Bhavan was also no different to this.
